Welcome to my homepage! I am Yindu Su (苏银都 in Chinese), an Algorithm Engineer at Alibaba Group.

Prior to joining Alibaba, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Technology in 2023 and my Bachelor's degree in Energy Engineering in 2020, both from Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of software engineering and data science.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or to discuss potential collaborations.
